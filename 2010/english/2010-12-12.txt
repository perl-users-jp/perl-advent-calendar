Class::Accessor::Lite - yet another accessor builder

Why does accessor builders modify @ISA? Doesn't it slow down method invocation? <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Accessor-Lite/">Class::Accessor::Lite</a> is a yet-another accessor builder.  The blurbs are:

- compatible interface with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Accessor-Fast/">Class::Accessor::Fast</a>
- does not alter @ISA
- no dependencies
- can set up read-only and / or write-only accessors and constructors

There is also a fancy interface (like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Object-Tiny/">Object::Tiny</a>) to construct the accessors.  The following code snippet should be self-explanatory.

>|perl|
package MyClass;

use Class::Accessor::Lite (
    new => 1,                # create constructor
    rw  => [ qw(foo bar) ],  # r/w accessor
    ro  => [ qw(baz) ],
    wo  => [ qw(hoge) ],
);
